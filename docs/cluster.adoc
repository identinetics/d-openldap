= Configuring Redundant OpenLDAP

- Use a common global configuration
  ** Either store it in LDAP, or
  ** Distribute a static configuration: include slapd_repl.conf in slapd.conf
- The configuration includes the list of servers:

    serverID  1 ldap://ldap1.local:8389
    serverID  2 ldap://ldap2.local:8389
    serverID  3 ldap://ldap3.local:8389

  And there is a

    syncrepl rid=1
        provider=ldap://ldap1.local:8389
        ...
    syncrepl rid=2
        provider=ldap://ldap2.local:8389
        ...
    syncrepl rid=3
        provider=ldap://ldap3.local:8389
        ...

One of the URIs in serverID must _exactly_ math the -h directive of the slaps startup command. This
way the daemon knows how to exclude itself form the repliaction. However, the URI may bind to the
docker host. In this case th name must be added to the local /etc/hosts when the container is
created (requires write access for user ldap)
